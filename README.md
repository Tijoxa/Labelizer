# Labelizer
GUI tool to label images in YOLO format

# Build from source
I think:
- Install Rust
- Install Tauri
- Run `npm install --save-dev @sveltejs/adapter-static`
- Run `cargo tauri build`

# Dev
TODO:
- Store image_paths in vec
- Show first image by default and add the possibility to navigate
